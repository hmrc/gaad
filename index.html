							<p class="govuk-body">Using Microsoft Teams – during the current home working period, our team has been having a twice weekly catch up via Teams. As an autistic person I find Tteams difficult for a couple of reasons. I can’t use a headset, as my brain interprets the sounds as pain, so I hadso had to obtain a wireless handset. This has improved my experience from a purely sensory perspective, but there are other barriers to overcome. We don’t use cameras. I can understand people’s reluctance, however for me, it’s a nightmare. If you are just listening, it’s difficult to work out when someone has finished saying their bit – autistic people struggle with conversation and knowing when it’s our turn to speak. This is exacerbated when all you are looking at is a grey circle! There are no visual clues to pick up on, and what’s more my colleagues don’t know from looking at me, whether I have something to say. With the result that sometimes two or more of us end up speaking at the same time! Think I’m going to have to persuade my colleagues to use cameras, lockdown hair or not…</p>
							<p class="govuk-body">I also have a positive story to share which is not work related. My boys do karate twice a week, and until lockdown this was in a local high school. The night of lockdown they did their purple belt grading in a local hotel, as the school had closed. The staff were literally locking up the hotel as they left! We were unsure how the club was going to continue, as much for the people who run it and for whom it is their livelihood, as for our boys. They are both autistic and our eldest has Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) as well – karate has improved their self-esteem, social skills and in the case of our eldest, his focus and concentration. So how did we overcome this? Zoom video conferencing!</p>
							<p class="govuk-body">It's been both amazing and at times hilarious especially at the start with people trying to connect and failing – there was a lot of “Rosie, are you there?” “ No, she’s gone…oh wait, she’s back!”, but it’s been a lifeline for our boys. It’s a continuation of part of their normal life, and although they haven’t physically seen their friends, they all see and talk to each other over Zoom twice a week. We even managed to connect our laptop to the TV so that they are working from a large screen instead of Dad’s mobile phone! That was something of a challenge….Their next grading is in the first week of July and given that our youngest has done more classes as he is at home, both of them should be ready to go for their next belt…it might even be over Zoom! I know we grumble about technology and how it can present barriers, but in this case, it has enabled the club owners to keep their business alive and our boys to retain some semblance of a normal life.</p>

							<p class="govuk-body">I’ve worked for HMRC for 33years (I’m including my time with C & E in that). Currently I’m the disability lead for the Bristol Regional Centre and the South West. I have had many roles but at the moment I’m a PA to a Grade 6 and a BUH. About 5 years ago I developed inflammatory arthritis and I take regular meds and have reduced my working hours to 30 per week to help my body to rest.</p>
							<p class="govuk-body">I have a Plantronics headset, small keyboard and a Roller Mouse Classic 2. I also use Dragon but only when the pain in my hands is bad so it isthat is hard to remember everything from the last time I used it as the time frames can be quite long for me needing to use it.</p>
							<p class="govuk-body">Since my diagnosis I’ve been lucky with the managers that I’ve had. They’ve all been understanding and helped me get the kit I have today. I am lift reliant on anything over two floors which worries me in the current climate even though I have got a mask. The arthritis is worse in my fingers, and wrists so on some days I find surfing either the web or Intranet hard if my joints are aching. Also, jumping from one site to another is hard along with typing one thing after another to try and find an answer to a question. It can be hard speaking to someone in IT if you’ve got an issue with your specific kit as your query has to be answered by someone else and then there’s more delay. I know this happens to a lot of people but to me it can exaggerate what could be a simple problem.</p>
							<p class="govuk-body">Times like I’ve mentioned above can be short or long and it becomes frustrating being in constant pain when you’re looking for something that was easy to find the other day. Depending on the pain level will dictate what painkillers I use and this can affect my vision along with making me tired.</p>
							<p class="govuk-body">Asking how your team could support you is a hard one because to me that depends on how much you want to divulge and for me personally it’s all about independence and being self-reliant. Search engines being better would help as this would lessen keying time. Also having an A-Z for dragon so you could use it as a refresher would be good.</p>
